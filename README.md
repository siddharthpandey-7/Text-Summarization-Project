# 📝 Text Summarization Web App (T5 + FastAPI)

An end-to-end **NLP text summarization application** built using a **fine-tuned T5 transformer model**, served through a **FastAPI backend** and integrated with a **simple frontend UI** for real-time inference.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on **dialogue summarization**, where long conversational text is converted into a short, meaningful summary.

### 🔹 What this project does
- Fine-tunes a **T5 model** on the **SAMSum dialogue summarization dataset**
- Exposes the trained model via a **FastAPI REST API**
- Provides a **frontend UI** (HTML/CSS/JS) to interact with the model
- Generates summaries in **real time**

---

## 🧠 Model Details

- **Model:** T5-Small (Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model)
- **Dataset:** SAMSum (dialogue → summary pairs)
- **Task:** Abstractive Text Summarization
- **Frameworks:** Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch

## 🔽 Model Weights (Important)

The trained T5 model is **not included in this repository** due to GitHub's file size limits.

### How to obtain the model

#### Option 1: Train the model yourself (recommended for learning)
- Train the model using the SAMSum dataset (Kaggle/Colab)
- Save the trained model as:
```
  t5_samsum/
```
- Place the folder in the project root before running the app

#### Option 2: Load from Hugging Face (recommended for deployment)
```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("your-hf-username/t5-samsum")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("your-hf-username/t5-samsum")
```

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters dialogue text in the UI
2. Frontend sends a POST request to `/summarize`
3. FastAPI backend:
   - Tokenizes input text
   - Runs inference using the fine-tuned T5 model
   - Decodes generated tokens
4. Summary is returned and displayed in the UI
