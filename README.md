# 📝 Text Summarization Web App (T5 + FastAPI)

An end-to-end **NLP text summarization application** built using a **fine-tuned T5 transformer model**, served through a **FastAPI backend** and integrated with a **simple frontend UI** for real-time inference.  
The application is **deployed for free on Hugging Face Spaces**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on **dialogue summarization**, where long conversational text is converted into a short, meaningful summary using a transformer-based deep learning model.

### 🔹 What this project does
- Fine-tunes a **T5 (Text-to-Text Transformer)** model on the **SAMSum dialogue summarization dataset**
- Uploads the trained model to the **Hugging Face Model Hub**
- Serves the model via a **FastAPI REST API**
- Provides a **frontend UI** (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) for user interaction
- Generates summaries in **real time**
- Fully deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces**

---

## 🧠 Model Details

- **Model:** T5-Small (Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model)
- **Dataset:** SAMSum (dialogue → summary pairs)
- **Task:** Abstractive Text Summarization
- **Frameworks:** Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch

📌 **Model hosted on Hugging Face Hub:**

📌 **Note:**  
The trained model weights are **not stored in this repository**.  
They are loaded dynamically from the **Hugging Face Model Hub**.

---

## 🔽 Model Loading Strategy (Important)

To avoid GitHub file size limits and ensure scalable deployment:

- The trained T5 model is uploaded separately to **Hugging Face Hub**
- The FastAPI app loads the model directly from the hub at runtime
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

MODEL_NAME = "siddharthpandey7/t5-samsum-summarizer"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)
```

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters dialogue text in the web UI
2. Frontend sends a POST request to `/summarize`
3. FastAPI backend:
   - Tokenizes the input text
   - Runs inference using the fine-tuned T5 model
   - Decodes the generated tokens
4. The generated summary is returned as JSON
5. The frontend displays the summary to the user
